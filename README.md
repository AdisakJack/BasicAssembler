# BasicAssembler
Basic Assembler program that I wrote for my assembly class. This program is meant to convert a fake assembly language to machine code. 
The fake ISA is called Ahrin ISA. Included in the project is the informationfor Ahrin and some example files as well as the expected output for those files.
